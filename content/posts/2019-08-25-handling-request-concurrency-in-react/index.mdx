Many blog articles talk about loading api/async data in a React apps, with `componentDidMount`, `useEffect`, or through Redux, Apollo...

Yet, all those articles are **generally optimistic**, and never mention something important to consider: race conditions could happen, and your UI may end up in an **inconsistant state**.

An image is worth a thousand words:

![](./images/trump-macron.png)

If there is a non-null probability that your UI end up in such a state, your app is subject to race conditions.

## Why this happens?

Sometimes, the UI end up having multiple requests being loading in parallel, and we just assume that the list fired request will resolve last. Actually, it may resolve first, or may just fail, leading to a former pending request being the last one to resolve.

It happens more often than you think. For some apps, it can lead to very serious problems, like **an user buying the wrong product**, or **a doctor prescribing the wrong drug to a patient**.

A non-exhaustive list of reasons:

- The network is slow, bad, unpredictable, with variable request latencies...
- The backend is under heavy load, throttling some requests, under a Denial of Service attack...
- The user is clicking fast, commuting, travelling, on the country side...
- You are just unlucky

Developers don't see them in development, where the network conditions are generally good, sometimes running the backend API on your own computer, with close to 0ms latency.

In this post, I'll try to demonstrate that those issues do, with simple but realistic network simulations and runnable demos. I'll also explain how you can fix those issues in many different ways, without requiring a large refactor.

## The incriminated code:

You probably already read tutorials with the following code:

```jsx
const StarwarsHero = ({ id }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setData(null);
    fetchStarwarsHeroData(id).then(
      result => setData(result),
      e => console.warn('fetch failure', e),
    );
  }, [id]);

  return <div>{data ? data.name : <Spinner />}</div>;
};
```

Eventually, it will also ensure to not set state after unmount, and avoid the React warning (not really the subject of this article):

```jsx
const useIsMounted = () => {
  const isMounted = React.useRef(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => (isMounted.current = false);
  });
  return isMounted;
};

const StarwarsHero = ({ id }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const isMounted = useIsMounted();

  useEffect(() => {
    setData(null);
    fetchStarwarsHeroData(id).then(
      result => isMounted.current && setData(result),
      e => console.warn('fetch failure', e),
    );
  }, [id]);

  return <div>{data ? data.name : <Spinner />}</div>;
};
```

Or with the React class API:

```jsx
class StarwarsHero extends React.Component {
  state = { data: null };

  fetchData = id => {
    fetchStarwarsHeroData(id).then(
      result => setState({ data: result }),
      e => console.warn('fetch failure', e),
    );
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchData(this.props.id);
  }

  componentDidUpdate(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps.id !== this.props.id) {
      this.fetchData(this.props.id);
    }
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.setState = () => {}; // I bet you didn't know this trick ;)
  }

  render() {
    const { data } = this.state;
    return <div>{data ? data.name : <Spinner />}</div>;
  }
}
```

Here is a Starwars Hero slider. All 3 versions above lead to this same result. Note debouncing would not protect you at all, it just reduces the chances of being unlucky.

<StarwarsHeroSliderDefault />

When clicking fast on the arrows, even with your own good home network, you can already see something is wrong.

Now let's see what happens when you are in a train with a few tunnels.

## Simulating bad network conditions

Let's build some utils to simulate bad network conditions:

```jsx
import { sample } from 'lodash';

// Will return a promise delayed by a random amount, picked in the delay array
const delayRandomly = () => {
  const timeout = sample([0, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 3000]);
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, timeout));
};

// Will throw randomly with a 1/4 chance ratio
const throwRandomly = () => {
  const shouldThrow = sample([true, false, false, false]);
  if (shouldThrow) {
    throw new Error('simulated async failure');
  }
};
```

### Adding network delays

This one is pretty realistic. You might be on a slow network, or the backend may take time to answer.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  setData(null);
  fetchStarwarsHeroData(id)
    .then(async data => {
      await delayRandomly();
      return data;
    })
    .then(result => setData(result), e => console.warn('fetch failure', e));
}, [id]);
```

<StarwarsHeroSliderDelay />

### Adding network failures

This one may not be so realistic, because generally network failures occur a delay.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  setData(null);
  fetchStarwarsHeroData(id)
    .then(data => {
      throwRandomly();
      return data;
    })
    .then(result => setData(result), e => console.warn('fetch failure', e));
}, [id]);
```

<StarwarsHeroSliderThrow />

### Adding network delays + failures

This time you are on a train in the countryside, and there are a few tunnels: requests are delayed randomly and some of them might fail.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  setData(null);
  fetchStarwarsHeroData(id)
    .then(async data => {
      await delayRandomly();
      throwRandomly();
      return data;
    })
    .then(result => setData(result), e => console.warn('fetch failure', e));
}, [id]);
```

As you can see, this code easily leads to weird, inconsistant UI states.

<StarwarsHeroSliderThrow />

## How to avoid this problem

Let's suppose 3 requests R1, R2 and R3 gets fired in this order, and are still pending. The solution is to only handle the response from R3, the last issued request.

There are 2 valid ways to do so:

- Ignoring responses from former api calls
- Cancelling former api calls

### Ignoring responses from former api calls

Here is one possible implementation.

```jsx
// A ref to store the last issued pending request
const lastPromise = useRef();

useEffect(() => {
  setData(null);

  // fire the api request
  const currentPromise = fetchStarwarsHeroData(id).then(async data => {
    await delayRandomly();
    throwRandomly();
    return data;
  });

  // store the promise to the ref
  lastPromise.current = currentPromise;

  // handle the result with filtering
  currentPromise.then(
    result => {
      if (currentPromise === lastPromise.current) {
        setData(result);
      }
    },
    e => {
      if (currentPromise === lastPromise.current) {
        console.warn('fetch failure', e);
      }
    },
  );
}, [id]);
```

<StarwarsHeroSliderIgnoring />

Some might be tempted to use the `id` to do the filtering, but it's not a good idea: if the user clicks `next` and then `previous`, we might end up with 2 distinct requests for the same hero. Generally this is not a problem (as the 2 requests will often return the exact same data), but using promise identity is a more generic and portable solution.

### Cancelling former api calls

If you can, it is better to cancel former api calls than ignoring them, as you'll end up consuming less resources. Hopefully, I'm using `fetch`, which support cancellation through its `AbortSignal` option:

```jsx
const abortController = new AbortController();

// fire the request, with an abort signal,
// which will permit premature abortion
fetch(`https://swapi.co/api/people/${id}/`, {
  signal: abortController.signal,
});

// abort the issued request
abortController.abort();
```

An abort signal is like a little event emitter, you can trigger it (through the `AbortController`), and every request started with this signal will be notified and cancelled.

Let's see how to use this feature to solve race conditions:

```jsx
// Store abort controller which will permit to abort
// the last issued request
const lastAbortController = useRef();

useEffect(() => {
  setData(null);

  // When a new request is going to be issued,
  // the first thing to do is cancel the previous request
  if (lastAbortController.current) {
    lastAbortController.current.abort();
  }

  // Create new AbortController for the new request and store it in the ref
  const currentAbortController = new AbortController();
  lastAbortController.current = currentAbortController;

  // Issue the new request, that may eventually be aborted
  // by a subsequent request
  const currentPromise = fetchStarwarsHeroData(id, {
    signal: currentAbortController.signal,
  }).then(data => {
    // You might notice I had to remove the bad network simulation code:
    // this is because it's not possible to abort
    // this part of the code with the abort signal
    return data;
  });

  currentPromise.then(
    result => setData(result),
    e => console.warn('fetch failure', e),
  );
}, [id]);
```

<StarwarsHeroSliderAborting />

## Using libraries

Doing all this manually is complex and error prone. Hopefully, some libraries solve this problem for you. Let's explore a non-exhaustive list of libraries generally used for loading data into React.

### Redux

There are multiple ways to load data into a Redux store. Generally, if you are using Redux-saga or Redux-observable, you are fine. For Redux-thunk, Redux-promise and other middlewares, you might check the "vanilla React/Promise" solutions in next sections.

#### Redux-saga

You might notice there are multiple `take` methods on the Redux-saga API, but generally you'll find many examples using [`takeLatest`](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/). This is because `takeLatest` will protect you against those race conditions.

```
Forks a saga on each action dispatched to the Store
that matches pattern. And automatically cancels any previous saga
task started previously if it's still running.
```

```jsx
function* loadStarwarsHeroSaga() {
  yield* takeLatest('LOAD_STARWARS_HERO', function* loadStarwarsHero(action) {
    try {
      const hero = yield fetch(`http://data.com/${action.payload.id}`);
      yield put({ type: 'LOAD_STARWARS_HERO_SUCCESS', hero });
    } catch (err) {
      yield put({ type: 'LOAD_STARWARS_HERO_FAILURE', err });
    }
  });
}
```

The previous `loadStarwarsHero` generator executions will be "cancelled". Unfortunately the underlying API request will not really be cancelled (you need an `AbortSignal` for that), but Redux-saga will ensure that the success/error actions will only be dispatched to Redux for the last requested Starwars hero. For in-flight request cancellation, follow [this issue](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/issues/1917)

Optionnally, you might opt-out from this protection and use `take` or `takeEvery`.

#### Redux-observable

Similarly to Redux-saga, Redux-observable has a solution. Actually, the solution is more related to RxJS and it's called [`switchMap`](https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/transformation/switchmap.html):

```
The main difference between switchMap and other flattening operators
is the cancelling effect. On each emission the previous inner observable
(the result of the function you supplied) is cancelled and
the new observable is subscribed. You can remember this
by the phrase switch to a new observable.
```

```jsx
const loadStarwarsHeroEpic = action$ =>
  action$.ofType('LOAD_STARWARS_HERO').switchMap(action =>
    Observable.ajax(`http://data.com/${action.payload.id}`)
      .map(hero => ({
        type: 'LOAD_STARWARS_HERO_SUCCESS',
        hero,
      }))
      .catch(err =>
        Observable.of({
          type: 'LOAD_STARWARS_HERO_FAILURE',
          err,
        }),
      ),
  );
```

You can also use other RxJS operators like `mergeMap` if you know what you are doing, but many tutorials will use `switchMap`, as it's a safer default. Like Redux-saga, it won't cancel the underlying request in-flight, but there are [solutions](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/3122) to add this behavior.

### Apollo

Apollo lets you pass down GraphQL query variables. Whenever the Starwars hero id changes, a new request is fired to load the appropriate data. You can use the HOC, the render props or the hooks, Apollo will always guarantee that if you request `id: 2`, your UI will never return you the data for another Starwars hero.

```jsx
const data = useQuery(GET_STARWARS_HERO, {
  variables: { id },
});

// This is always true, hopefully!
assert(data.id === id);
```

### Vanilla React

There are many libraries to load data into React components, without needing a global state management solution.

I created [react-async-hook](https://github.com/slorber/react-async-hook): a very simple and tiny hooks library to load async data into React components. It has very good native Typescript support, and protects you against race conditions by using the techniques discussed above.

```jsx
import { useAsync } from 'react-async-hook';

const fetchStarwarsHero = async id =>
  (await fetch(`https://swapi.co/api/people/${id}/`)).json();

const StarwarsHero = ({ id }) => {
  const asyncHero = useAsync(fetchStarwarsHero, [id]);
  return (
    <div>
      {asyncHero.loading && <div>Loading</div>}
      {asyncHero.error && <div>Error: {asyncHero.error.message}</div>}
      {asyncHero.result && (
        <div>
          <div>Success!</div>
          <div>Name: {asyncHero.result.name}</div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Other options protecting you:

- [react-async](https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async): quite similar and a bit more featured (render props)
- [react-refetch](https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch): older project, based on HOCs

There are many other library options, for which I won't be able to tell you if they are protecting you: take a look at the implementation.

**Note**: it's possible `react-async-hook` and `react-async` will merge in the next months.

**Note:**: it's possible to use `StarwarsHero key={id} key={id}/>` as a simple React workaround, to ensure the component instance stanges everytime the id changes. This will effectively protect you (and some time unmounting/remounting is useful), but will also give more work to React.

### Vanilla promises and Javascript

If you are dealing with vanilla promises and Javascript, here are simple tools you can use to prevent those issues.

Those tools can also be useful to handle race conditions if you are using thunks or promises with Redux.

**Note**: some of these tools are actually low-level implementation details of [react-async-hook](https://github.com/slorber/react-async-hook).

#### Cancellable promises

React has an old blog post [isMounted() is an antipattern](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/16/ismounted-antipattern.html) on which you'll learn how to make a promise cancellable to avoid the setState after unmount warning. The promise is not really `cancellable` (the underlying api call won't be cancelled), but you can choose to ignore or reject the response of a promise.

I made a library [awesome-imperative-promise](https://github.com/slorber/awesome-imperative-promise) to make this process easier:

```jsx
import { createImperativePromise } from 'awesome-imperative-promise';

const id = 1;

const { promise, resolve, reject, cancel } = createImperativePromise(fetchStarwarsHero(id);

// will make the returned promise resolved manually
resolve({
  id,
  name: "R2D2"
});

// will make the returned promise rejected manually
reject(new Error("can't load Starwars hero"));

// will ensure the returned promise never resolves or reject
cancel();
```

**Note**: all those methods have to be called before the underlying API request resolves or reject. If the promise is already resolved, there's no way to "unresolve" it.

#### Automatically ignoring last call

[awesome-only-resolves-last-promise](https://github.com/slorber/awesome-only-resolves-last-promise) is another cool library to ensure we only handle the result of the last async call:

```jsx
import { onlyResolvesLast } from 'awesome-only-resolves-last-promise';

const fetchStarwarsHeroLast = onlyResolvesLast(fetchStarwarsHero);

const promise1 = fetchStarwarsHeroLast(1);
const promise2 = fetchStarwarsHeroLast(2);
const promise3 = fetchStarwarsHeroLast(3);

// promise1 and promise2 will never resolve/reject
// promise3 will resolve in 100ms
```

### What about Suspense?

It should prevent those issues, but let's wait for the official release :)

## Conclusion

For your next React data loading usecase, I hope you will consider handling race conditions properly.

I can also recommend to hardcode some little delays to your API requests in development environment. Potential race conditions and bad loading experiences will be more easy to notice. I think it's safer to make this delay mandatory, instead of expecting each developer to turn on the slow network option in devtools.

I hope you've found this post interesting and you learned something, it was my first technical blog post ever :)
