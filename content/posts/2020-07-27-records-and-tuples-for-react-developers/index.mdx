Records & Tuples is a very interesting [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) for the JavaScript language, that just reached [stage 2](https://twitter.com/robpalmer2/status/1286040041089904640) at TC39.

In this article, I want to show you how it is going to impact your React codebase, in a pragmatic way.

# Records & Tuples 101

This article is about Records & Tuples **for React**. I'll only cover the basics here.

They looks like regular Objects and Arrays, with a **#** prefix.

```js
const record = #{a: 1, b: 2};

const updatedRecord = #{...record, b: 3};
// #{a: 1, b: 3};

const tuple = #[1, 2, 3, 4];

const filteredTuple = tuple.filter(num => num > 2)
// #[3, 4];
```

They are **deeply immutable** by default.

```js
const record = #{a: 1, b: 2};

record.b = 3;
// throws TypeError
```

They can be seen as **"compound primitives"**, and can be compared by value. Two deeply equal records will always have the same identity.

```js
{a: 1, b: [3, 4]} === {a: 1, b: [3, 4]}
// false

#{a: 1, b: #[3, 4]} === #{a: 1, b: #[3, 4]}
// true
```

They are interoperable with JSON:

```js
const record = JSON.parseImmutable('{a: 1, b: [2, 3]}');
// #{a: 1, b: #[2, 3]}

JSON.stringify(record);
// '{a: 1, b: [2, 3]}'
```

They can only contain other records and tuples, or primitive values.

```js
const record = #{
  a: 1,
  b: new Date(),
  c: new MyClass()
};
// throws TypeError
```

# Records & Tuples for React

React developers are now used to **immutability**.
Every time you update some piece of state in an immutable way, you create **new object identities**.

But this immutability model has introduced a whole new class of bugs, and performance issues in React applications.
Sometimes, a component works correctly and in a performant way, only under the assumption that props preserve identities as most as they can over time.

I like to think about Records & Tuples as a convenient **way to make object identities more "stable"**.

Let's see how this proposal will impact your React code with practical use cases.

## Immutability

Enforcing immutability can be achieved with `Object.freeze()` applied recursively.

But in practice, we often use the immutability model without enforcing it too strictly, as it's not convenient to apply `Object.freeze()` after each update. Yet, mutating the React state directly is a common mistake for new React developers.

The Records & Tuples proposal will enforce immutability, and prevent state mutation mistakes:

```js
const Hello = ({profile}) => {

   // prop mutation: throws TypeError
   profile.name = "Sebastien updated" // throws TypeError

   return <p>Hello {profile.name}</p>;
}

function App() {
   const [profile, setProfile] = React.useState(#{ name: "Sebastien" });

   // state mutation: throws TypeError
   profile.name = "Sebastien updated" // throws TypeError

   return <Hello profile={profile}/>
}
```

## Immutable updates

There are many ways to perform immutable state updates in React: vanilla JS, Lodash's set, ImmerJS, ImmutableJS (check [my article](https://dev.to/sebastienlorber/insight-3-use-immerjs-over-lodash-set-immutablejs-or-plain-js-36bl).

I think it's safe to say that [ImmerJS](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) has won this battle, due to its simplicity and interoperability with regular JS code.

Michael Weststrate (author of ImmerJS), has highlighted in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/mweststrate/status/1263482177934819329), Records & Tuples can be updated deeply without requiring a lib like ImmerJS:

```js
const initialState = #{
    counters: #[
        #{ name: "Counter 1", value: 1 },
        #{ name: "Counter 2", value: 0 },
        #{ name: "Counter 3", value: 123 },
    ],
    metadata: #{
        lastUpdate: 1584382969000,
    },
};

const updatedState = #{
    ...initialState,
    counters[0].value: 2,
    counters[1].value: 1,
    metadata.lastUpdate: 1584383011300,
};
```

This is part of a [separate proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-deep-path-properties-for-record), currently at stage 1.
