This post hope to inspire you to get started with cross-platform development.

I'll show it's possible (and easy) to embed runnable React-Native demos inside a Gatsby blog post. You will find demos and a bit of code at the end.


------------------------------------------------


You probably heard of [React-Native-Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), permitting to render React-Native views on the web. So, why not on a static website?

React-Native now has a [lean core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313). Somehow, [Expo](https://expo.io/) can be seen as an extension to React-Native SDK: it offers a much larger API surface, enabling richer experiences.

These last years, Expo (particularly [Evan Bacon](https://twitter.com/baconbrix)) has done a great work to bring support for web to many of its APIs, and new APIs tend to be crafted with the web platform in mind.

React-Native-Web might look complicated to setup. Expo created [@expo/webpack-config](@expo/webpack-config), a default Webpack config that enables you to get started fast (without configuring babel loader, enabling the `.web.js` extension, adding svg support...).


------------------------------------------------


# React-Native, Expo and Gatsby

I'm the maintainer of [gatsby-plugin-react-native-web](https://github.com/slorber/gatsby-plugin-react-native-web).

The version 3.0 is now out of beta, and uses under the hood `@expo/webpack-config`.
This means you basically just need to add the plugin to `gatsby-config.js`, and nothing else is required to get started. If you tried former versions, you should consider trying again with this one.

Your favorite ReactNative libs and UI kits should work out of the box.
There might still be a few edge cases (please report them), but I'm confident it's now ready for adoption.


------------------------------------------------



# Call to action


### You are a React-Native, Expo developer?


It's time to embed some real, runnable React-Native code in your blog posts. And yes, it works with [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), with a Gatsby theme (like [mine](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela)!), with [Docz](https://www.docz.site/)...

You can do this with [NextJS](https://dev.to/evanbacon/next-js-expo-and-react-native-for-web-3kd9) too. [Evanbacon.dev](http://evanbacon.dev/) is build with NextJS and Expo. But really, you can use [@expo/webpack-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/webpack-config) anywhere there is webpack.

If you have an Expo app, it's also time to try the `expo build --web` command.


### You are a web developer?

I still encourage you to try this plugin, just to get a better idea about what React-Native-Web is.

In case you don't aim to share code between web and mobile, React-Native-Web can be seen as a low-level UI kit, including its own performant CSS-in-JS system, with a few specificities like [atomic CSS](http://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/?path=/docs/guides-style--page#implementation-details).
It's so good, that Twitter choose to use this for their mobile and desktop websites, despite they don't even use ReactNative on mobile.
Facebook also hired React-Native-Web author [Nicolas Gallagher](https://twitter.com/necolas), and the new Facebook (in beta), is using a proprietary atomic CSS framework (XStyle?).
This atomic CSS strategy has been reported to scale extremely well for large websites (see this [React Conf 2019 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JZHodNR184)).

It has also been speculated that [React-Native might simply become a better choice for building websites than React-DOM](https://www.swyx.io/writing/react-native-web-singularity/).



### You are a lib author?

It's time to seriously think about cross-platform development.
What if your lib could be used everywhere, instead of just the web OR mobile?

Apart from Expo, React-Native core, and a few React-Native UI kits, there is a lack of quality cross-platform components for rich experiences (toasts, maps, credit card inputs...).
[expo-dark-mode-switch](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dark-mode-switch) is a good cross-platform component example. Using [expo-module-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-module-scripts) might help you publish something.

Publishing cross-platform  libraries might become as important for consumers as publishing a library with type definitions.
Think about how annoying it is when you want to use a JS library but find out it does not have TypeScript defitions?
Or when you want to use a JS library in Node, but find out it unnecessarily depends on some global browser object? In the future, not publishing cross-platform React widgets might create the same level of frustration. I think it's time to make the cross-platform ecosystem great, and the Expo team show us the way.

# Demo time

I won't explain how React-Native-Web works here, there are other posts in this subject (I might write one).

These demos may not look very impressive, but keep in mind they are all written with React-Native and Expo components / apis.
There's no usage of a single `div` in the codebase here, nor any DOM usage.
All these demos can also run in React-Native (natively, no WebView).

import {
  ExpoCameraDemo,
  ExpoDarkModeSwitchDemo,
  ExpoBatteryDemo,
  ExpoGesturesDemo,
  ExpoSvgDemo,
  ExpoVideoDemo,
  ExpoImagePickerDemo,
} from './components';


------------------------------------------------

So, let's start with a simple one.
Can I display the battery of your computer? Yes!

<ExpoBatteryDemo />

------------------------------------------------


Can I render a complex svg with react-native-svg? Yes!

<ExpoSvgDemo />


------------------------------------------------


Can I use a cross-platform component, like [expo-dark-mode-switch](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dark-mode-switch), and wire it to my Gatsby theme-ui state? Yes!

<ExpoDarkModeSwitchDemo />

------------------------------------------------



Can I ask you permission to use your camera, and reveal it with a little fade-in animation? Yes!

<ExpoCameraDemo />

------------------------------------------------


Can I use more complex gesture-based systems? Yes!

<ExpoGesturesDemo />



Can I play a video? Yes!

<ExpoVideoDemo />

------------------------------------------------


Can I build an image picker, and enable a few image transformations? Yes!

<ExpoImagePickerDemo />

------------------------------------------------

In case you wonder what the code looks like, here's a snippet for the camera demo.
You can find the rest of the code [here](https://github.com/slorber/sebastienlorber.com/tree/master/content/posts/2020-04-21-using-expo-and-gatsby-together).

```jsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

import MobilePhoneView from 'components/MobilePhoneView';
import AppButton from 'components/designSystem/AppButton';
import AppRevealView from 'components/designSystem/AppRevealView';

export const ExpoCameraDemo = () => {
  const [showCamera, setShowCamera] = useState(false);
  return (
    <MobilePhoneView safeAreaPaddingTop={0}>
      {showCamera ? (
        <AppRevealView>
          <Camera style={{ flex: 1, width: '100%' }} />
        </AppRevealView>
      ) : (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center' }}>
          <AppButton
            onPress={async () => {
              const result = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);
              if (result.status === 'granted') {
                setShowCamera(true);
              }
            }}
          >
            Show expo-camera
          </AppButton>
        </View>
      )}
    </MobilePhoneView>
  );
};
```

------------------------------------------------


I hope these demos will help you understand that cross-platform works, is not so hard to setup, and is ready for wide-spread adoption.

I'll update this post regularly, if I find new interesting cross-platform experiences (feel free to send me some).

# Toward cross-platform MDX content authoring

All these demos use React Native and Expo code, and they can run natively on React-Native.
These demos are embedded in this markdown post using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).
Fortunately, MDX can be run on React-Native too!

This actually means that... **my posts are cross-platform**?

Stay tuned: in upcoming blog posts, I'll show you how I run my MDX blog posts inside an Expo app.
