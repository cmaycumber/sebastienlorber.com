You probably heard of [React-Native-Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), permitting to render React-Native views on the web. So, why not on a static website?

React-Native now has a [lean core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313). [Expo](https://expo.io/) can be seen as an extension to React-Native SDK: it offers a much larger API surface, enabling richer experiences.

These last years, Expo (particularly [Evan Bacon](https://twitter.com/baconbrix)) has done a great work to bring support for web to many of its APIs, and new APIs tend to be crafted with the web platform in mind.

React-Native-Web might look complicated to setup, and Expo created [@expo/webpack-config](@expo/webpack-config), a good default config that enables you to get started fast, without the need to deal too much with Webpack config (configuring babel loader, enabling the `.web.js` extension, svg support, fonts loading...).


# React-Native, Expo and Gatsby

I've been maintaining the [gatsby-plugin-react-native-web](https://github.com/slorber/gatsby-plugin-react-native-web). The version 3.0 is now out of beta, and uses under the hood `@expo/webpack-config`.

This means you basically just need to add the plugin to `gatsby-config.js`, and nothing else is required to get started.

Your favorite ReactNative libs and UI kits should work out of the box.

There might still be a few edge cases (please report them), but I'm confident it's now ready for adoption.


------------------------------------------------







# Call to action


### You are a React-Native or Expo developer?

It's time to embed some real, runnable React-Native code in your blog posts.

And yes, it does work in [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) too!

It also works if you use a [Gatsby theme like me](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela)!

All sites based on Gatsby can use this, including [Docz](https://www.docz.site/).

It's also possible to do so with [NextJS](https://dev.to/evanbacon/next-js-expo-and-react-native-for-web-3kd9), if you prefer it to Gatsby. [Evanbacon.dev](http://evanbacon.dev/) is build with NextJS and Expo.

But really, you can use [@expo/webpack-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/webpack-config) anywhere there is webpack.

If you have an Expo app, it's also time to try the `expo build --web` command.


### You are a web developer?

I still encourage you to try this plugin, just to get a better idea about what React-Native-Web is.

In case you don't aim to share code between web and mobile, React-Native-Web can be seen as a low-level UI kit, including its own performant CSS-in-JS system, with a few specificities like [atomic CSS](http://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/?path=/docs/guides-style--page#implementation-details).

It's so good, that Twitter choose to use this for their mobile and desktop websites, despite they don't even use ReactNative on mobile.

Facebook also hired React-Native-Web author [Nicolas Gallagher](https://twitter.com/necolas), and the new Facebook (in beta), is using a proprietary atomic CSS framework (XStyle?).

This atomic CSS strategy has been reported to scale extremely well for large websites (see this [React Conf 2019 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JZHodNR184)).

It's also been speculated by Swyx that [React-Native might become a better choice for a website than React-DOM](https://www.swyx.io/writing/react-native-web-singularity/).



### You are a lib author?

It's time to seriously think about cross-platform development.

What if your lib could be used everywhere, instead of just the web OR mobile?

Publishing cross-platform might become as important for consumers as publishing a library with type definitions.

Apart from Expo, React-Native core, and a few React-Native UI kits, there is a lack of quality cross-platform components for rich experiences (toasts, maps, credit card inputs...).

[expo-dark-mode-switch](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dark-mode-switch) is a good cross-platform component example.

Using [expo-module-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-module-scripts) might help you publish something cross-platform.

# Demo time

I won't explain how React-Native-Web works here, there are other posts in this subject (I might write one).

These demos may not look very impressive, but keep in mind they are all written with React-Native and Expo components / apis.
There's no usage of a single `div` in the codebase here, nor any DOM usage.
All these demos can also run in React-Native (natively, no WebView).

import {
  ExpoCameraDemo,
  ExpoDarkModeSwitchDemo,
  ExpoBatteryDemo,
  ExpoGesturesDemo,
  ExpoSvgDemo,
  ExpoVideoDemo,
  ExpoImagePickerDemo,
} from './components';


------------------------------------------------

So, let's start with a simple one.
Can I display the battery of your computer? Yes!

<ExpoBatteryDemo />

------------------------------------------------


Can I render a complex svg with react-native-svg? Yes!

<ExpoSvgDemo />


------------------------------------------------


Can I use a cross-platform component, like [expo-dark-mode-switch](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dark-mode-switch), and wire it to my Gatsby theme-ui state? Yes!

<ExpoDarkModeSwitchDemo />

------------------------------------------------



Can I ask you permission to use your camera, and reveal it with a little fade-in animation? Yes!

<ExpoCameraDemo />

------------------------------------------------


Can I use more complex gesture-based systems? Yes!

<ExpoGesturesDemo />



Can I play a video? Yes!

<ExpoVideoDemo />

------------------------------------------------


Can I build an image picker, and enable a few image transformations? Yes!

<ExpoImagePickerDemo />

------------------------------------------------


I hope these demos will help you understand that cross-platform works, is not so hard to setup, and is ready for wide-spread adoption.

I'll update this post regularly, if I find new interesting cross-platform experiences (feel free to send me some).


------------------------------------------------


# Toward cross-platform MDX content authoring

As I said, all these demos use React Native and Expo code, and they can run natively on React-Native.

These demos are embedded in this markdown post using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx). Fortunately, MDX can be run on React-Native too!

This actually means that my posts are... cross-platform?

Stay tuned, in upcoming blog posts, I'll show you how I embed my MDX blog posts in an Expo app.

For a preview, scan my [Expo QRCode](https://expo.io/@slorber/sebastien-lorber), or take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/slorber/sebastienlorber.com) :)
