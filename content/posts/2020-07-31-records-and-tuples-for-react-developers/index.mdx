Records & Tuples is a very interesting [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) for the JavaScript language, that just reached [stage 2](https://twitter.com/robpalmer2/status/1286040041089904640) at TC39.

A whole category of React bugs are related to **unstable object identities**:

- **Performance**: can trigger re-renders that could be avoided
- **Behavior**: can trigger useless effect re-executions, and lead to infinite loops
- **API surface**: we don't have a way to express when a stable object identity matters

I will explain the basics of **Records & Tuples**, and how they can solve **real world React issues**.

# Records & Tuples 101

This article is about Records & Tuples **<u>for React</u>**. I'll only cover the basics here.

They look like regular **Objects and Arrays**, with a **#** prefix.

```jsx
const record = #{a: 1, b: 2};

const updatedRecord = #{...record, b: 3};
// #{a: 1, b: 3};

const tuple = #[1, 2, 3, 4];

const filteredTuple = tuple.filter(num => num > 2)
// #[3, 4];
```

They are **deeply immutable** by default.

```jsx
const record = #{a: 1, b: 2};

record.b = 3;
// throws TypeError
```

They can be seen as **"compound primitives"**, and can be compared by value.

**VERY IMPORTANT**: two deeply equal records will **ALWAYS** have the same identity.

```jsx
{a: 1, b: [3, 4]} === {a: 1, b: [3, 4]}
// with objects => false

#{a: 1, b: #[3, 4]} === #{a: 1, b: #[3, 4]}
// with records => true
```

They are interoperable with JSON:

```jsx
const record = JSON.parseImmutable('{a: 1, b: [2, 3]}');
// #{a: 1, b: #[2, 3]}

JSON.stringify(record);
// '{a: 1, b: [2, 3]}'
```

They can only contain other records and tuples, or primitive values.

```jsx
const record = #{
  a: {
    regular: 'object',
  },
  b: new Date(),
  c: new MyClass(),
  d: function () {
    alert('forbidden');
  },
};
// throws TypeError
```

**Note**: you can add such values to a Record by using [references](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple#could-i-box-a-pointer-to-an-object-and-put-that-in-a-record-or-tuple).

# Records & Tuples for React

React developers are now used to **immutability**.

Every time you update some piece of state in an immutable way, you create **new object identities**.

Unfortunately, this immutability model has introduced a whole new class of bugs, and performance issues in React applications.
Sometimes, a component works correctly and in a performant way, **only under the assumption that props preserve identities** as most as they can over time.

I like to think about Records & Tuples as a convenient way to **make object identities more "stable"**.

Let's see how this proposal will impact your React code with practical use cases.

### Immutability

Enforcing immutability can be achieved with recursive `Object.freeze()` calls.

But in practice, we often use the immutability model without enforcing it too strictly, as it's not convenient to apply `Object.freeze()` after each update. Yet, mutating the React state directly is a common mistake for new React developers.

The Records & Tuples proposal will **enforce immutability**, and prevent common state mutation mistakes:

```jsx
const Hello = ({ profile }) => {
  // prop mutation: throws TypeError
  profile.name = 'Sebastien updated';

  return <p>Hello {profile.name}</p>;
};

function App() {
  const [profile, setProfile] = React.useState(#{
    name: 'Sebastien',
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    // state mutation: throws TypeError
    profile.name = 'Sebastien updated';
  }, []);

  return <Hello profile={profile} />;
}
```

### Immutable updates

There are [many ways](https://dev.to/sebastienlorber/insight-3-use-immerjs-over-lodash-set-immutablejs-or-plain-js-36bl) to perform immutable state updates in React: vanilla JS, Lodash set, ImmerJS, ImmutableJS...

So far, [ImmerJS](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) has won this battle, due to its simplicity, and interoperability with regular JS code.

Michael Weststrate himself has [highlighted](https://twitter.com/mweststrate/status/1263482177934819329) that Records & Tuples can be updated deeply natively, and ImmerJS may become unneeded:

```jsx
const initialState = #{
  counters: #[
    #{ name: "Counter 1", value: 1 },
    #{ name: "Counter 2", value: 0 },
    #{ name: "Counter 3", value: 123 },
  ],
  metadata: #{
    lastUpdate: 1584382969000,
  },
};

// Update with ImmerJS:
const updatedStateImmer = Immer.produce(initialState,draft => {
  draft.counters[0].value: 2,
  draft.counters[1].value: 1,
  draft.metadata.lastUpdate: 1584383011300,
})

// Update with vanilla JS:
const updatedStateNative = #{
  ...initialState,
  counters[0].value: 2,
  counters[1].value: 1,
  metadata.lastUpdate: 1584383011300,
};
```

This is part of a [separate proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-deep-path-properties-for-record).

### useMemo

In addition to memoizing expensive computations, `useMemo()` is also useful to **avoid creating new object identities**, that might **trigger useless computations, re-renders, or effects executions deeper in the tree**.

Let's consider the following use-case: you have an UI with multiple filters, and want to fetch some data from the backend.

Existing React code-bases might contain code such as:

```jsx
// Don't change apiFilters object identity,
// unless one of the filter changes
// Not doing this is likely to trigger a new fetch
// on each render
const apiFilters = useMemo(
  () => ({ userFilter, companyFilter }),
  [userFilter, companyFilter],
);

const { apiData, loading } = useApiData(apiFilters);
```

With Records & Tuples, this simply becomes:

```jsx
const {apiData,loading} = useApiData(#{ userFilter, companyFilter })
```

### useEffect

Let's continue with our api filters use-case:

```jsx
const apiFilters = { userFilter, companyFilter };

useEffect(() => {
  fetchApiData(apiFilters).then(setApiDataInState);
}, [apiFilters]);
```

Unfortunately, the fetch effect gets **re-executed**, because the identity of the `apiFilters` object changes every time this component re-renders. `setApiDataInState` will trigger a re-render, and you will end up with an infinite fetch/render loop.

This mistake is so common across React developers that there are thousand of Google search results for **[useEffect + "infinite loop"](https://www.google.com/search?q=useEffect+%2B+%22infinite+loop%22)**.
Kent C Dodds even created [a tool](https://github.com/kentcdodds/stop-runaway-react-effects) such infinite loops in development.

Very common solution: create `apiFilters` directly in the effect's callback:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const apiFilters = { userFilter, companyFilter };
  fetchApiData(apiFilters).then(setApiDataInState);
}, [userFilter, companyFilter]);
```

Another creative solution (not very performant, found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/acutmore/status/1256533631914426369)):

```jsx
const apiFiltersString = JSON.stringify({
  userFilter,
  companyFilter,
});

useEffect(() => {
  fetchApiData(JSON.parse(apiFiltersString)).then(
    setApiDataInState,
  );
}, [apiFiltersString]);
```

The one I like the most:

```jsx
// We already saw this somewhere, right? :p
const apiFilters = useMemo(
  () => ({ userFilter, companyFilter }),
  [userFilter, companyFilter],
);

useEffect(() => {
  fetchApiData(apiFilters).then(setApiDataInState);
}, [apiFilters]);
```

There are many fancy ways to solve this problem, but they all tend to **become annoying**, as the number of filters increase.

They are much **more verbose and less idiomatic** than their Records & Tuples counterpart:

```jsx
const apiFilters = #{ userFilter, companyFilter };

useEffect(() => {
  fetchApiData(apiFilters).then(setApiDataInState);
}, [apiFilters]);
```

### Props and React.memo

Preserving object identities in props is also very useful for React performances.

Another very common performance mistake: create new objects identities in render.

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
  useRerenderEverySeconds();
  return (
    <ExpensiveChild
      // someData props object is created "on the fly"
      someData={{ attribute1: 'abc', attr2: 'def' }}
    />
  );
};

const ExpensiveChild = React.memo(({ someData }) => {
  return <div>{expensiveRender(someData)}</div>;
});
```

Most of the time, this is not a problem, and React is fast enough.

But sometimes you are looking to optimize your app, and this new object creation makes the `React.memo()` useless. Worst, it actually **makes your application a little bit slower** (as it now has to run an additional shallow equality check, always returning false).

Another pattern I often see in client code-bases:

```jsx
const currentUser = { name: 'Sebastien' };
const currentCompany = { name: 'Lambda Scale' };

const AppProvider = () => {
  useRerenderEverySeconds();

  return (
    <MyAppContext.Provider
      value={{ currentUser, currentCompany }}
    />
  );
};
```

Despite the fact that `currentUser` or `currentCompany` **never gets updated**, your context value changes every time this provider re-renders, which trigger re-renders of all context subscribers.

All these issues can be solved with memoization:

```jsx
const someData = useMemo(
  () => ({ attribute1: 'abc', attr2: 'def' }),
  [],
);

<ExpensiveChild someData={someData} />;
```

```jsx
const contextValue = useMemo(
  () => ({ currentUser, currentCompany }),
  [currentUser, currentCompany],
);

<MyAppContext.Provider value={contextValue} />;
```

With Records & Tuples, it is **idiomatic to write performant code**:

```jsx
<ExpensiveChild someData={#{ attribute1: 'abc', attr2: 'def' }} />;
```

```jsx
<MyAppContext.Provider value={#{ currentUser, currentCompany }} />;
```

### Fetching and re-fetching

There are many ways to fetch data in React: `useEffect`, HOC, Render props, Redux, SWR, React-Query, Apollo, Relay, Urql, ...

Most often, we hit the backend with a request, and get some JSON data back.

To illustrate this section, I will use [react-async-hook](https://github.com/slorber/react-async-hook), my own very simple fetching library, but this applies to other libraries as well.

Let's consider a classic async function to get some API data:

```jsx
const fetchUserAndCompany = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://myBackend.com/userAndCompany`,
  );
  return response.json();
};
```

This app fetches the data, and ensure this data stays "fresh" (non-stale) over time:

```jsx
const App = ({ id }) => {
  const { result, refetch } = useAsync(
    fetchUserAndCompany,
    [],
  );

  // We try very hard to not display stale data to the user!
  useInterval(refetch, 10000);
  useOnReconnect(refetch);
  useOnNavigate(refetch);

  if (!result) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <User user={result.user} />
      <Company company={result.company} />
    </div>
  );
};

const User = React.memo(({ user }) => {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
});

const Company = React.memo(({ company }) => {
  return <div>{company.name}</div>;
});
```

Problem: you have used `React.memo` for performance reasons, but every time the re-fetch happens, you end up with a new JS object, with a **new identity**, and **everything re-renders**, despite the fetched data being the **same as before** (deeply equal payloads).

Let's imagine this scenario:

- you use the "Stale-While-Revalidate" pattern (show cached/stale data first, then refresh data in the background)
- your page is complex, render intensive, with lots of backend data being displayed

You navigate to a page, that is already expensive to render the first time (with cached data). One second later, the refreshed data comes back. Despite being deeply equal to the cached data, everything re-renders again. Without [Concurrent Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html) and time slicing, some users may even notice **their UI freezing** for a few hundred milliseconds.

Now, let's convert the fetch function to return a Record instead:

```jsx
const fetchUserAndCompany = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://myBackend.com/userAndCompany`,
  );
  return JSON.parseImmutable(await response.text());
};
```

By chance, JSON is compatible with Records & Tuples, and you should be able to convert any backend response to a Record, with [JSON.parseImmutable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple#jsonparseimmutable).

**Note**: it is likely that a new `response.immutableJson()` function will be added, according to [Robin Ricard](https://twitter.com/r_ricard).

With Records & Tuples, if the backend returns the same data, you **don't re-render anything** at all!

Also, if only one part of the response has changed, the other nested objects of the response will still **keep their identity**. This means that if only `user.name` changed, the `User` component will re-render, but not the `Company` component!

I let you imagine the performance impact of all this, considering patterns like "Stale-While-Revalidate" are becoming increasingly popular, and provided out of the box by libraries such as SWR, React-Query, Apollo, Relay...

## Reading query strings

In search UIs, it's a good practice to **preserve the state of filters in the querystring**. The user can then copy/paste the link to someone else, refresh the page, or bookmark it.

If you have 1 or 2 filters, that's simple, but as soon as your search UI becomes complex (10+ filters, ability to compose queries with AND/OR logic...), you'd better use a good abstraction to manage your querystring.

I personally like [qs](https://github.com/ljharb/qs): it's one of the few libraries that handle nested objects.

```jsx
const queryStringObject = {
  filters: {
    userName: 'Sebastien',
  },
  displayMode: 'list',
};

const queryString = qs.stringify(queryStringObject);

const queryStringObject2 = qs.parse(queryString);

assert.deepEqual(queryStringObject, queryStringObject2);
```

You can integrate the querystring parsing in a hook.

```jsx
const useQueryStringObject = () => {
  // Provided by your routing library, like React-Router
  const { search } = useLocation();
  return useMemo(() => qs.parse(search), [search]);
};
```

Now, imagine that deeper in the tree you have:

```js
const { filters } = useQueryStringObject();

useEffect(() => {
  fetchUsers(filters).then(setUsers);
}, [filters]);
```

This is a bit nasty here, but the same problem happens again and again.

Despite the usage of `useMemo()` to try to preserve `queryStringObject` identity, you will end up with unwanted `fetchUsers` calls.

When the user will update the `displayMode` (that should only change the rendering logic, not trigger a re-fetch), the querystring will change, leading to the querystring being parsed again, leading to a new object identity for the `filter` attribute, leading to the unwanted `useEffect` execution.

Again, Records & Tuples would prevent such things to happen.

```jsx
// Unfortunately, the Record(obj) conversion function is not recursive
// there's a recursive conversion method here:
// https://tc39.es/proposal-record-tuple/cookbook/index.html
// Here's a non-performant, but working solution:
const parseQueryStringAsRecord = (search) => {
  return JSON.parseImmutable(
    JSON.stringify(qs.parse(search)),
  );
};

const useQueryStringRecord = () => {
  const { search } = useLocation();
  return useMemo(() => parseQueryStringAsRecord(search), [
    search,
  ]);
};
```

Now, if the user updates the `displayMode`, the `filters` object will preserve its identity, and not trigger any useless re-fetch.

### Deeply equal JS transformations

Imagine the following JS transformation in a component:

```jsx
const AllUsers = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Sebastien' },
  { id: 2, name: 'John' },
];

const Parent = () => {
  const userIdsToHide = useUserIdsToHide();

  const users = AllUsers.filter(
    (user) => !userIdsToHide.includes(user.id),
  );

  return <UserList users={users} />;
};

const UserList = React.memo(({ users }) => (
  <ul>
    {users.map((user) => (
      <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
));
```

Every time the `Parent` component re-renders, the `UserList` component re-render as well, because `filter` will always return a **new array instance**.

This is the case even if `userIdsToHide` is empty, and `AllUsers` identity being stable! In such case, the filter operation does not actually filter anything, it just **creates new useless array instances**, opting out of our `React.memo` optimisations.

These kind of transformations are very common in React codebase, with operators such as `map` or `filter`, in components, reducers, selectors, Redux...

Memoization can solve this, but it's more idiomatic with Records & Tuples:

```jsx
const AllUsers = #[
  #{ id: 1, name: 'Sebastien' },
  #{ id: 2, name: 'John' },
];

const filteredUsers = AllUsers.filter(() => true);

AllUsers === filteredUsers;
// true
```

### Explicit API surface

Let's consider this TypeScript component:

```jsx
const UsersPageContent = ({
  usersFilters,
}: {
  usersFilters: UsersFilters,
}) => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  // poor-man's fetch
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUsers(usersFilters).then(setUsers);
  }, [usersFilters]);

  return <Users users={users} />;
};
```

This code may or may not create an infinite loop, as we have seen already, depending on how stable the usersFilters prop is. This creates an implicit API contract that should be documented and clearly understood by the implementor of the parent component, and despite using TypeScript, this is not reflected in the type-system.

The following will lead to an infinite loop, but TypeScript has no way to prevent this:

```jsx
<UsersPageContent
  usersFilters={{ nameFilter, ageFilter, companyFilter }}
/>
```

With Records & Tuples, we can tell TypeScript to expect a Record:

```jsx
const UsersPageContent = ({
  usersFilters,
}: {
  usersFilters: #UsersFilters;
}) => {};
```

**Note**: the `#UsersFilters` is invented: we don't know yet what will be the TypeScript syntax.

And TypeScript compilation will fail for:

```jsx
<UsersPageContent
  usersFilters={{ nameFilter, ageFilter, companyFilter }}
/>
```

While TypeScript would accept:

```jsx
<UsersPageContent
  usersFilters={#{ nameFilter, ageFilter, companyFilter }}
/>
```

With Records & Tuples, we can prevent this infinite loop at **compile time**.

We have an **explicit** way to tell the compiler that our **implementation is object-identity sensitive**.

**Note**: `readonly` would not solve this: it only prevents mutation, but does not guarantee a stable identity.

### Serialization guarantee

You may want to ensure that developers on your team don't put unserializable things in global app state. This is important if you plan to send the state to the backend, or persist it locally in `localStorage` (or `AsyncStorage` for React-Native users).

To ensure that, you just need to ensure that the root object is a record. This will guarantee that all the nested attributes are also records, tuples, or primitives.

Here's an example integration with Redux, to ensure the Redux store keeps being serializable over time:

```jsx
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  ReduxStore.subscribe(() => {
    if (typeof ReduxStore.getState() !== 'record') {
      throw new Error(
        "Don't put non-serializable things in the Redux store! " +
          'The root Redux state must be a record!',
      );
    }
  });
}
```

### CSS-in-JS performances

Let's consider some CSS-in-JS from a popular lib, using the css prop:

```jsx
const Component = () => (
  <div
    css={{
      backgroundColor: 'hotpink',
    }}
  >
    This has a hotpink background.
  </div>
);
```

Your CSS-in-JS library receives a new CSS object on every re-render.

On first render, it will hash this object as a unique class name, and insert the CSS.
The style object has a different identity for each re-render, and the CSS-in-JS library have to **hash it again and again**.

```jsx
const insertedClassNames = new Set();

function handleStyleObject(styleObject) {
  // computeStyleHash re-executes every time
  const className = computeStyleHash(styleObject);

  // only insert the css for this className once
  if (!insertedClassNames.has(className)) {
    insertCSS(className, styleObject);
    insertedClassNames.add(className);
  }

  return className;
}
```

With Records & Tuples, the identity of such a style object is preserved over time.

```jsx
const Component = () => (
  <div
    css={#{
      backgroundColor: 'hotpink',
    }}
  >
    This has a hotpink background.
  </div>
);
```

Records & Tuples can be used as [Map keys](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple#usage-in-mapsetweakmapweakset). This could make the implementation of your CSS-in-JS library faster:

```jsx
const insertedStyleRecords = new Map();

function handleStyleRecord(styleRecord) {
  let className = insertedStyleRecords.get(styleRecord);

  if (!className) {
    // computeStyleHash is only executed once!
    className = computeStyleHash(styleRecord);
    insertCSS(className, styleRecord);
    insertedStyleRecords.add(styleRecord, className);
  }

  return className;
}
```

We don't know yet about Records & Tuples [performances](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple#what-are-the-performance-expectations-of-these-data-structures) (this will depend on browser vendor implementations), but I think it's safe to say it will be faster than creating the equivalent object, and then hashing it to a className.

**Note**: some CSS-in-JS library with a good babel plugin might be able to transform static style objects as constants at compilation time, but they will have a hard time doing so with dynamic styles.

```jsx
const staticStyleObject = { backgroundColor: 'hotpink' };

const Component = () => (
  <div css={staticStyleObject}>
    This has a hotpink background.
  </div>
);
```

# Conclusion

Many React performance and behavior issues are related to object identities.

**Records & Tuples** will ensure that object identities are **"more stable"** out of the box, by providing some kind of **"automatic memoization"**, and help us solve these React problems more easily.

TypeScript will permit to express better that your API surface is **object-identity sensitive**.

I hope you are now as much excited as I am by this proposal!
